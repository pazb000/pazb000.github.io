        <p> Websites The Good And The Bad Essay </p>
        <p>When it comes to website as much as anything in life first impressions can be made in a mere matter of seconds, the design of a website is pivotal in shaping the user's experience. when I looked at these websites this is the most importing thing I had on my mind to make the pick of two great websites and one bad one. also, it was important to me evaluating the elements that define the good and the bad in web design. On two websites that show excellence in different ways user-friendliness of Airbnb and the effect that amazon has on people to help make it sell so many products on a wide scale. When it comes to the bad website that I found it is visibly not an eye pleasing website and I’m sure that most of the traction that this website gets are people like me looking for what not to do when making a website andCritiquing the unfortunate missteps of a website that fails. Lastly unraveling the nuances of code, layout, color schemes, and the subtleties that separate exceptional web design from the forgettable. </p>
    
        <p>  <a href="https://www.airbnb.com"/a> Airbnb </a>  stands out to me and I knew I wanted to look over this website because of prior experience I have a had looking for a place to stay. The moment you land on Airbnb's homepage, you're greeted with a clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing interface. The design is not just visually appealing; it's also highly functional. The homepage prominently features a user-friendly search bar, positioned at the top and in big letter list “anywhere”, which enables visitors to input their destination and travel dates immediately. Which is very seamless and experience which I like and I figure many others enjoy. Also, Airbnb's use of high-quality images of destinations is visually captivating, offering users a preview of the possibilities nearby awaiting them as soon as you open the website. The site's navigation is effortlessly and with well-organized categories and filters that facilitate easy refinement of search criteria. Whether you're a seasoned traveler or a first-time user, Airbnb's design ensures that you can swiftly access the information you need and book your next adventure with confidence. Lastly I really like at the top of the page right underneath the search bar all the tables have fun images of cabins, omg amazing views ,mansions, beach fronts ,etc. Airbnb is a prime example of web design but also plays a pivotal role in shaping the positive experiences that users associate with the platform.</p>
        
        
        <p>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com"/a> Amazons website. </a>Amazon's website is a masterclass in e-commerce web design. From the moment you land on the homepage, you're greeted by various product you may be looking for offerings and user-friendly features. The design is strategically structured to not only capture your attention but also guide you seamlessly through the online marketplace. Amazon's search bar a prominent encouraging visitor to quickly begin their product searches. Beneath this is tab that moves about every 15 seconds showing you around some of its features without you even scrolling a products and deals engages users with visually appealing content. The website's layout is both responsive and organized, ensuring that regardless of the device you're using, the site adapts gracefully to provide an optimal viewing experience. What sets Amazon apart is its exceptional recommendation engine, which leverages user data to provide tailored product suggestions, creating an almost personalized shopping experience. Additionally, their efficient checkout process, customer reviews, and one-click purchase options make for a hassle-free shopping journey. I also like how simplistic it is and don’t feel like its doing to much with colors but at the same time not plain. Amazon's website is not just a digital storefront it is a comprehensive shopping ecosystem, characterized by its intuitive design, product diversity, and the ability to entice and convert visitors into satisfied customers.   </p>
        
        

        <p> <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu"/a> The Yale School of Art's website </a> unfortunately, example of what not to do in web design I found this website on another website called 40 worst websites. Upon entering the site, users are immediately confronted with a cluttered and visually unpleasing interface. The absence of clear navigation and organization leaves you disoriented and frustrated. The color scheme and layout are discordant, making it challenging to focus on any specific content to the point where I’m not even sure what this website is about it feels like a scam and not a site to be trusted. The user experience has slow loading times, and a convoluted menu structure. This making it difficult for visitors to find the information they It serves as a valuable cautionary example, emphasizing the importance of user-centric design and maintaining a web presence. One thing that was good about this website is when I made the tab smaller the website would get smaller with it. Also all the links worked but they looked even worst then the home page. I feel like this site is purposely terrible or I at least hope its is. </p>
        
        
        <p> In conclusion, the world of website design is fascinating in the fact of there is so much variety   where first impressions hold immense power and could affect someone’s business in a good or bad way.  for outstanding websites, Airbnb and Amazon, it became evident that user-friendliness and the ability to captivate and engage visitors are key components of a great web design. These platforms not only deliver seamless experiences but also influence user behavior on a massive scale. On the other side of the spectrum, it is apparent that we can see the opposite like with yale school of art that shows what to avoid when creating an online presence. It's a testament to the fact that a poorly designed website can deter users and drive them away. Something that surprised me throughout this prosses is how many other websites there are out there with poor coding and are very plain and boring. although web design isn't just about aesthetics valuable experiences for users that leave a lasting impact. </p>
